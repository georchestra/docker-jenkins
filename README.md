About
======

This is a simple repository which provides a Jenkins docker image meant to
build geOrchestra.

If you look for a docker image suitable for a jenkins slave instead, please have a look on the `jenkins-slave-builder` branch (https://github.com/georchestra/docker-jenkins/tree/jenkins-slave-builder).


Usage
======

```
$ docker build -t georchestra/jenkins:<tag> .
```

Creating jobs
================

TODO, depending on what we want to do (debian packages, docker images, ...).
